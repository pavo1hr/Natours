## Implementation
The goal of this project was to take care of multiple **CSS, Sass and HTML** features and to develop a modern design web page.
In particular there where some important functionalities i wanted to learn:
• **Advanced CSS animations with @keyframes, animation and transition**;
• **Advanced CSS selectors, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements required for modern CSS development**;
• **How CSS works behind the scenes**: the cascade, specificity, inheritance, value processing, the visual formatting model, the box model, box types, positioning schemes and stacking contexts;
• **CSS architecture**: The 7-1 rule, component-based design, the BEM methodology, writing reusable, maintainable and scalable code;
• **Sass**: variables, nesting, partials, imports, mixins, functions, extends, and more;
• **Using Sass in real-world projects**: setting global variables, building for reusability, architecting CSS and managing media queries;
• **The NPM ecosystem**: setting up a development process to compile Sass and automatic browser reload, and creating a build process to concatenate, prefix and compress CSS files;
• **Modern responsive design**: fluid grids, layout types, flexible images, using media queries to test for different screen widths, pixel densities and touch capabilities;
• **Advanced responsive design workflows**: mobile-first vs desktop-first strategies, selecting breakpoints, em vs rem units and feature queries to test for browser support;
• **Responsive images in HTML and CSS for faster pageloads**: resolution switching, density switching, art direction;
• **SVG images in HTML and CSS**: how and why to use SVG, generating SVG sprites, changing SVG colors in CSS and best practices;
• **Videos in HTML and CSS**: building a background video effect;
• **Flexbox layouts**: main concepts, introduction to both flex container and flex item specific properties, advanced positioning techniques applied to a huge real-world project;
• **CSS Grid layouts**: main concepts, CSS grid vs flexbox, and layout techniques applied to a real-world project. This part alone could be an entire course!
This project was done with the CSS floats and some cool CSS animations.
