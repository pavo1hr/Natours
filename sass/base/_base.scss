    to be able to modify the default font-size from its browser.
    - The best practice is to actually use a percentage: since most of the times the default
    value of the font-size in a browser is 16px -> 10px/16px * 100 = 62.5%. Where 10px is
    the size in pixels we wanted to  use. -> so in this way 1rem = 10px = 16px * 62.5%.
